// Base58 is used for compact human-friendly representation of Bitcoin addresses and private keys.
// Typically Base58-encoded text also contains a checksum.
// Addresses look like 19FGfswVqxNubJbh1NW8A4t51T9x9RDVWQ
// Private keys look like 5KQntKuhYWSRXNqp2yhdXzjekYAR7US3MT1715Mbv5CyUKV6hVe
//
// Here is what Satoshi said about Base58:
// Why base-58 instead of standard base-64 encoding?
// - Don't want 0OIl characters that look the same in some fonts and
//      could be used to create visually identical looking account numbers.
// - A string with non-alphanumeric characters is not as easily accepted as an account number.
// - E-mail usually won't line-break if there's no punctuation to break at.
// - Double-clicking selects the whole number as one word if it's all alphanumeric.

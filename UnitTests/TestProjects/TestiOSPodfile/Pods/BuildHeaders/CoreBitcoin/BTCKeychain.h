// Implementation of BIP32 "Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets" (HDW)
// https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki
//
// BTCKeychain encapsulates either a pair of "extended" keys (private and public), or only a public extended key.
// "Extended key" means the key (private or public) is accompanied by extra 256 bits of entropy called "chain code" and
// some metadata about it's position in a tree of keys (depth, parent fingerprint, index).
// Keychain has two modes of operation:
// - "normal derivation" which allows to derive public keys separately from the private ones (internally i below 0x80000000).
// - "hardened derivation" which derives only private keys (for i >= 0x80000000).
// Derivation can be treated as a single key or as an new branch of keychains.

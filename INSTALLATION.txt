How to build and use as a framework:

0. 	check out from github

1. 	run update_openssl.sh
	This will build the OpenSSL library for all the architectures you may need

2.  run build_libraries.sh
	This will create the frameworks and static libraries containing everything 
	you need to include EthCore in other projects.
	
3.	Drag and drop one of the .framework files into your project. If you have
	targets for both OSX and iOS in the same project you have to use both frameworks.
	In this case you need to uncheck "Copy items into destination group's folder", as the
	two files have the same name.
	
4.	Add the framework(s) to the target(s) where you want to use them. (if you haven't done
	so when adding the files to the project)
	
5.  include the header files where you need them, such as:
	#import <EthCore/BTCAddress.h>
